<i>NOTE: Mostly changes were just refactoring of widgets, instead presenting repeating views with a ForEach to make the code more readable. 
Otherwise, the basic structure of the file has been the same as it included everything wanted prior. </i>

My question struct for what appears on the app is totally different to both variants of how the question struct was set up in your demonstration.
Instead of having it as a string with one struct, I instead had 2 structs. You will see it in the video. This helps the reshuffling of questions
of which could not be handled with an enum as I would have to add a whole lote of code to handle more of different selections.
